   Get cookies with requests.

2. Use cookies to get the newest course id. (from https://m.bjyouth.net/dxx/index)
3. Send a request to https://m.bjyouth.net/dxx/check?id=50&org_id=172442 to finish learning.(you can visit [org list](https://m.bjyouth.net/org/list) to get org_id)

## Multi-user Support

Your ``config.yaml`` should be like this:

```

## Back up plan

In general, it is always possible to go through the normal process in selenium headless mode, but the current method is feasible, so I will not continue to develop it now.
